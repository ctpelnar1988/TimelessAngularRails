      <p class="international_description_text">
        Come to our Kissimmee office for an initial in-person consultation.<br><br> This initial examination is an important part of the process as it helps to determine the future course of action and also keeps you informed of the steps you need to take to prepare for surgery and the time period required for recovery.<br><br> Those finding it difficult to travel can arrange for an educational and informative virtual consultation over the Internet with one of our non-physician staff members. The purpose of the virtual consultation is to provide you an opportunity to obtain more information about the SmartLipo Triplex liposuction procedure to assist you in deciding whether to travel to our Kissimmee office for an initial in-person consultation with one of our plastic surgeons.<br><br> In addition, the virtual consultation enables us to obtain from you certain preliminary information about your medical history and medical condition which our plastic surgeons can review subsequent to your virtual consultation but prior to your in-person consultation to assist them in determining your eligibility for SmartLipo laser liposuction treatment.<br><br> If, after conducting a virtual consultation, you are still interested in obtaining SmartLipo treatment, the next step would be to schedule an in-person consultation with one of our plastic surgeons. Click here for our virtual consultation procedure.

        After your initial consultation, if you decide to go ahead with your SmartLipo procedure, we will explain the scheduling options and provide assistance with hotel arrangements.<br><br> We will also arrange for your pre-surgery medical examination, by one of our trained plastic surgeons, to confirm your medical eligibility for surgery. To secure dates for surgery, you are required to pay a deposit by either check or credit card. Final payment needs to be made at the pre-operative visit.<br><br> Shortly after your SmartLipo Triplex liposuction treatment is scheduled, you will receive copies of various consent forms and useful instructions for you to review.<br><br> On the first day you arrive, one of our plastic surgeons will meet with you to conduct a detailed pre-operative medical examination, give you pre- and post-operative instructions and go over the consent forms with you.<br><br> After we have explained everything and answered all of your questions, you will then sign all of the consent forms.
