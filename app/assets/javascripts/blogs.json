    "description": "Of course, women love to have well-shaped breasts that enhance overall body contour and femininity. However, abnormally large breasts can lead to concerns such as poor posture, and shoulder, neck and back pain as well as emotional trauma and psychological stress.  Many studies have reported that breast reduction surgery can relieve back pain. In one of the studies, it was reported that 74% of women who underwent the procedure said they experienced relief from back and neck pain in comparison to 21% who had not undergone the surgery. The basic underlying rationale was that the removal of 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) or more of breast tissue results in considerable cutback of biomechanical load on the spine, thereby reducing back pain.  One report cites a study published in 2002 which found that 73 patients reported improvement in posture 84% and activity levels 77% after reduction mammaplasty. The effect on back pain was also quite significant with 41% of those who reported severe back pain before surgery saying that it disappeared completely postoperatively.  Another study presented at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Plastic Surgery 2009 conference reported that women who have breast reduction surgery may be at a decreased risk for spine and other back disorders. The participants reported dramatic improvements in their capability to carry out dynamic movements and endure static positions.  A study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the official medical journal of ASPS in 2013 confirms increased overall well-being for women after breast reduction. Measurable improvements in diverse important areas of health and quality of life for women were reported. The research noted that as reported in previous studies, the procedure relieved had pain in the breast, neck, back and shoulders.  Breast reduction treatment helps resolve other issues too:  Neck pain and headaches Spine problems Skin irritation or rashes Bra strap indents on shoulders Reduced muscle weakness and disability The procedure is widely accepted. It was recently revealed that tennis player Simona Halep which helped improve the way she played. Breast reduction liposuction performed using advanced, minimally invasive technologies such as SmartLipo Triplex has made the treatment easier and safer, with patient benefits such as minimal scarring and discomfort, and quicker recovery.",

    "title": "Fat Transfer for Natural Breast and Buttock Augmentation",
    "description": "Fat grafting is proving a very useful technique in aesthetic surgery. A recent study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® revealed that in recent years, a large majority of US plastic surgeons used fat grafting techniques when they performed facelift surgery.  Fat grafting involves removing fat via liposuction from strategic areas such as the abdomen or thighs to reshape or enhance other areas. While this is a popular technique for breast and buttock augmentation, the study published by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reveals that fat transfer is being widely used by cosmetic surgeons in the US to improve the results of facelift surgery.  The New York University researchers surveyed a random sample of ASPS members to know how often they use fat transfer for facelift procedures. They also collected information on the fat collection, processing, and transfer steps. Responses received from 309 ASPS Member Surgeons revealed that:  85 percent used fat grafting when performing facelift procedures. More than 70 percent said they had started using autologous fat grafts for the face within the past ten years. Fat was mostly taken from the abdominal area and injected in small amounts. The total amount of fat they injected was normally between 11 and 25 cc, that is, no more than a few teaspoons. The main treatment site was the cheek, with fat injections used to address age-related deflation and provide a fuller, more rounded appearance. Other common sites for fat grafting were the nasolabial folds between the nose and corners of the mouth and area below the lower eyelids. Despite some fat getting reabsorbed, the surgeons noted that most of the fat was retained up to one year after face lifting. Follow-up procedures were performed after four to six months if necessary to refine the results. Patient and surgeon satisfaction rates with the results of fat grafting were good. Face lifts involve repositioning of existing facial fat to enhance appearance. According to the researchers, fat grafting is especially useful when it comes to providing additional volume when the desired facial shape and “volumetric highlights” cannot be achieved by such repositioning.  The rapid adoption of fat grafting in facelift surgery shows that the surgeons believe that facial fat repositioning and fat grafting are complementary techniques that can enhance facial shape.",

    "title": "Patient Education is Crucial for Better Liposuction Outcomes",
    "description": "Three decades since it was introduced, liposuction continues to be one of the most popular cosmetic surgical procedures in the U.S. and other countries across the world. This simple procedure removes excess fat and contours the body when diets and exercise fail to produce the desired results.  The success of any cosmetic procedure depends on its efficacy, safety and longevity and to achieve these goals, patient awareness is important. Patient education is crucial to improve the liposuction experience and outcomes. An educated patient can make informed decisions, be more confident, and participate in planning the surgery, all of which would promote an optimal outcome.  Let look at factors that contribute to the safety, efficiency and longevity of liposuction surgery:  First, the prospective patient needs to know about what makes a person a good candidate for the procedure. The ideal candidate is one who has isolated areas of fat that are out of proportion with adjacent areas and resistant to diet and exercise. Having good skin tone and not too much excess skin is important as minimally invasive lipolysis can only remove stubborn pockets of fat and tighten the skin. You should be aware about the liposuction options that are available and discuss with your surgeon as to which one would be the most suitable for you. It is important to inform your surgeon about your condition, health status concerns and expectations. Ask your surgeon about the benefits as well as the risks of the procedure so that you can make an informed decision. This will also serve to reduce your anxiety and build trust with your surgeon. All cosmetic surgery procedures come with risks. However, with a qualified and experienced surgeon you can expect complications to be minimal. An educated patient will do thorough research to find the right surgeon. Patient education is also critical for liposuction aftercare. The patient needs to follow the surgeon’s instructions on aftercare which may also include self-managing certain elements of their care. Educated patients will take steps to heal more quickly and more efficiently, and to prolong the outcome with a healthy lifestyle.",

    "title": "Report: ‘Safe’ Amount of Liposuction Varies by Body Weight",
    "description": "The aim of liposuction surgery is to remove excess fat that is resistant to diet and exercise. However, one important question that patients often ask is: ‘what is the maximum amount of fat that can be safely removed?’ It is stressed that patients should have realistic expectations about this as lipolyis is not a solution for weight loss and is only intended to remove localized deposits of fat. Now, Science Daily reports that new study published in the September issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery indicates that though there is no hard-and-fast rule as to how much liposuction is safe, the answer lies in the patient’s body mass index (BMI).  According to current American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) guidelines define 5,000 milliliters (five liters) as “large-volume liposuction” which is potentially linked with a high risk of complications. However, there is no scientific data that supports this.  The new study is based on data pertaining to more than 4,500 liposuction patients. The researchers evaluated the relationship between liposuction volume and complication risk, including links to the patient’s BMI, and came up with some interesting findings:  The average liposuction volume was about two liters The overall complication rate was 1.5 percent with only a very few serious complications and no deaths Seroma or fluid collection requiring drainage was among the most common complications Those who had large volume liposuction of about 3.4 liters and higher BMIs had complications – for “large-volume” liposuction of more than five liters the overall complication rate was 3.7 versus 1.1 percent The complication rate was found to be lower in patients with higher BMIs who had a greater liposuction volume. This meant that obese patients may tolerate large volume lipo without higher risk of complications In contrast, patients with lower BMIs who had higher liposuction volumes experienced a “more exponential increase in risk” It is for the first time that a study has evaluated the relationship between the patient’s BMI and “safe” liposuction volumes. However, the researchers point out that, besides BMI, other factors such as such as length of surgery, additional procedures, and the patient’s overall health status need to be considered when evaluating liposuction risks.  The lead researcher says that their findings will also help patients and plastic surgeons collaborate better in the decision-making process to make plastic surgery safer and more effective.",

    "title": "How Does Wearing Compression Garments After Liposuction Surgery Help?",
    "description": "Liposuction is a popular body contouring procedure that removes excess fat deposits from different body areas such as abdomen, thighs and hips. The treatment is really helpful when even strenuous diet and exercise sessions don’t provide the desired results. FDA approved procedures such as SmartLipo Triplex laser liposuction successfully treats almost all areas. Regardless of the technique used, plastic surgeons give patients specific instructions to follow to ensure fast and smooth recovery. One of the important things recommended to speed up recovery is wearing a compression garment after the treatment.  Benefits of Compression Garments  So how exactly does wearing a compression garment help recovery? It does so by preventing edema or swelling, improving circulation and supporting the skin.  Reduces swelling: In laser lipo, a local anesthetic is injected into the treatment site. While this method comes with fewer risks than general anesthesia, it does cause some swelling on the skin in the area. Wearing a compression garments helps reduce the swelling and speed up healing. Improves blood circulation: Proper blood flow to the treated area helps the tissues heal. Compression garments are designed to promote movement of blood and lymph fluids to the liposuction area. It minimizes bruising or helps in faster healing. Helps the skin adapt to the changes: It’s true that laser lipo tightens the skin. However, the skin can adapt more easily to the new shape with the help of the compression garment. The garment helps the skin adhere to the muscles and other underlying structures and prevents it from becoming loose and saggy. However, not all garments are the same and choosing the right option is important to ensure comfort and efficacy. Select a garment that is comfortable, easy to put on and take off. It should not be too tight or too loose. Quality garments also do not cause pain or itching. Your plastic surgeon can help you make the right choice.  How long you would need to wear the garment depends on a number of factors such as the amount of fat removed, how much loose skin remains, the elasticity of your skin, and so on. Generally, a liposuction patient is advised to wear the garment for three weeks full time and the next three weeks, for twelve hours at a time (day or night).",

    "description": "Men and women who adhere to healthy diet and exercise routines may continue to be bothered by stubborn fat deposits in certain areas. Plastic surgeons provide the solution with liposuction, the procedure designed to remove this excess fat, tighten the skin, and improve body contour. Advancements in techniques such as Smartlipo Triplex laser liposuction have made it possible to treat practically almost all areas of the body. While some of the areas respond with great results, others may be even visually transformed.  Most women choose to have the treatment to improve areas such as the abdomen, flanks, hips, outer and inner thighs, and upper arms. The upper arms are likely to get fuller and flabby with age and do not respond well to diet and exercise. Upper arm sculpting involves removing excessive fat and sagging skin, allowing women to confidently wear sleeveless and strapless clothes.  Recent data on cosmetic surgical procedures show that men account for about 15-25 percent of liposuction patients in most practices. The neck and chin area, abdomen, flanks and breasts are common aesthetic concerns among men. Gynecomastia (overly large male breasts) is effectively addressed with liposuction surgery and results in a more masculine appearance.  Aging and weight gain can cause fullness in the neck and make you look heavy and older. The neck area responds very well to liposuction. The procedure can prove transformative for both men and women as a stronger jawline can change the way the face looks. Unlike other areas, even a small amount of fat reduction in this area can make a noticeable improvement in the definition of the face.  Liposuction surgery provides good results for the right candidate – people who are healthy, have good quality skin, a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or less, and one or two areas of the body that can benefit with treatment. It is also important to have realistic expectations – lipo removes localized deposits of fat and is not a weight loss tool.",

    "description": "Stylish boots are among the top fashion buys in the fall when temperatures in the US fall. This is the time women put away their strappy sandals and pull out their knee-high boots. In winter too, tall boots help combat slush and snow, besides amping up the style quotient. Popular models include the slouchy style, front lacing style and one with a buckle to adjust calf width. In addition to choosing the style that suits you, proper fitting at the calf is important to look good. Buying stylish boots but not getting the perfect fit spoils the look. The good news is that there is a smart way to get rid of the bulgy look and get slimmer legs to get the best fit – calf liposuction.  Liposuction is a widely requested body contouring procedure which helps remove excess fat deposits resistant to diet and exercise from various areas of the body. The most common areas of treatment include the abdomen, thighs and hips. However, laser liposuction allows effective fat reduction and reshaping of even smaller and more delicate areas. A report published last year revealed that many women are turning to calf-reduction surgery to fit into knee-high boots.  Liposuction helps tackle the ‘boot bulge’ by slimming the legs from the knee down. Of course, the treatment would work only for women with some excess fat, and not just muscle, in the area. The experience and expertise of the plastic surgeon also matters as micro-liposuction is necessary to remove very small amounts of fat from delicate areas such as the ankles and calves. Lipo using Smartlipo Triplex is the popular option.  Recovery from calf reduction surgery takes comparatively more time than for other areas, possibly up to 10 months. Many women recover after 4-5 months and would need to wear a snug compression knee-high stocking for at least two months after the procedure to help reduce swelling and improve skin adhesion.  You can maintain the results of the procedure with proper exercise and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet. Fitness experts recommend running, swimming and cycling as good strategies to keep calves slim. Avoid activities that will create bigger bulkier muscle. For instance, resistance exercises may increase the size of the calf muscle and not slim down calves.",

    "description": "Liposuction is undoubtedly one among the most popular cosmetic surgical procedures among men and women. However, one should not be complacent once the treatment is over as a healthy lifestyle is crucial to maintain the results. With the holiday season approaching, it’s important that you know this if you are considering or had a body contouring surgery.  Research has shown that liposuction patients are much more likely to put on weight if they do not stick to a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen compared to those who did so. A study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® some time ago reported that liposuction patients are 3 times more likely to gain weight without adhering to a proper diet and 4 times more likely to gain weight without regular exercise. The study also found that patients who do not follow a healthy lifestyle after liposuction may be “considerably less happy” with their outcome. So it’s obvious that patients play a significant role in the long-term success of their liposuction results  The author of the study cautioned, “This is especially important to remember as we approach the holiday season when people are invited to more parties and social activities where diet and exercise may be overlooked.”  The study found that patients with poor eating and exercise habits are likely to gain weight with 62 percent chance of an increase in clothing size. This could make them ten times more likely to be dissatisfied with their results compared to their counterparts.  On the other hand, the study reported that those who adhere to a proper diet after liposuction surgery are two times more likely to lose weight and have a 96 percent chance of a decrease in clothing size, making them about 15 times more satisfied with the outcome.  The bottom line: patients must understand that they are solely responsible for the long-term results of their liposuction treatment by implementing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",

    "description": "Lipedema is a chronic condition in which fat is distributed unevenly beneath your skin, mostly in the buttocks and legs. This affects up to 11% of women and is a major cosmetic concern that can lead to a painful condition if left untreated. A study presented at the 23rd Annual World Congress of Dermatology said liposuction can address this concern and significantly improve the quality of life of lipedema patients.  According to this report, the study revealed that the treatment resulted in a significant reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue, which in turn improved body proportions and overall shape. The study involved a total of 164 patients who had conservative lipedema therapy over several years. These patients were treated with liposuction in tumescent local anesthesia with vibrating microcannulas. Eighty five patients were re-evaluated via questionnaire. This was done in 2010, a mean of 3 years and 8 months following surgery, and in 2014, after a mean of 7 years and 8 months.  The findings of the study are interesting.  A considerable reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue was noted among the patients. According to the 2010 results, their spontaneous pain significantly improved or completely disappeared. Sensitivity to pressure, edema, cosmetic impairment, bruising, and restriction of movement also improved. Patients reported an enormous improvement in the quality of their life. Most of them were able to reduce decongestive therapy. According to the 2014 results, the improvements continued over time. The mean overall impairment reduced significantly from “severe” prior to the procedure to “mild” at follow-ups. No serious complications were observed following the surgery. For almost 30% of the patients, conservative therapy was completely stopped. With similar applications, liposuction has improved its role from just a cosmetic procedure to being effective treatment for medical conditions that need a reduction in fat. With advanced techniques such as laser lipo using Smartlipo Triplex, the procedure blends safety with efficiency and offers an optimal outcome.",

    "description": "An increasing number of men and women are looking to resolve their stubborn fat deposits with minimally invasive laser liposuction surgery as it offers effective results with negligible side effects and short downtime. The cost of the treatment would vary based on several factors such as your specific needs, technology used, where you get the treatment, and more. It’s important to be aware of the factors that impact cost if you are considering the body contouring procedure.  Area of concern: Cost will depend on the area that needs treatment. It can be lower for small areas such as chin, face, jowls, thighs or neck compared larger areas such as upper abdomen, breasts or back. Number of areas and volume of fat to be removed: If you plan to have lipolysis in multiple areas, costs will be higher. Also, more sessions would be required for the removal of a larger amount of fat, and this would take up the cost. Surgeon’s expertise: A professional plastic surgeon with vast experience in performing liposuction would charge more. Geographic Location: Cost also depends on where you have the treatment. Compared to a small town or suburb, costs would be higher in a major city and metropolitan area. Consultation fees: Some surgeons may offer a free consultation while others may charge you for their valuable time. Some other surgeons include consultation fees in the overall treatment cost. Other factors: Other factors influencing cost include fees for anesthesia, operating room use, medical tests, prescription medications, and the cost of compression garments. The surgical facility in which the procedure is performed also affects costs. Treatment in a big hospital would be more expensive than in a small clinic. For your safety and good results, it’s important to choose an AAAASF-accredited plastic surgery practice.  Liposuction is a highly individualized procedure, so the best option is to talk to your surgeon about what it will cost you. Established surgeons offer financing plans to help patients pay for elective procedures. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) offers some sound advice for prospective liposuction candidates when it says, “…remember that the surgeon’s experience and your comfort with him or her are just as important as the final cost of the surgery”.",

    "description": "Liposuction is steadily gaining popularity as one of the choicest body contouring treatments that can work wonders in improving your body shape. With superior techniques such as laser liposuction using Smartlipo Triplex, efficiency and safety have increased considerably. It helps remove excess fat and shape up common areas of the body such as the abdomen, thighs and buttocks.  Exercise and diet may have little impact when it comes to eliminating fat from the chin, jaw line, calf and groin areas, whereas this lipo treatment can work wonders. Double chin is a bothersome aesthetic concern for many men and women. Double chin liposuction can help get rid of the excess fat in the chin area and tighten the skin to restore a natural contour.  Some other trouble spots that can be effectively treated with this advanced body contouring procedure include the following.  Lipo of the jaw line, the area under the chin, and the upper neck will make you look thinner, taking years off your appearance. Targeted body contouring can successfully remove fat from your back and upper torso, providing a sculpted look and attractive curves. Cankles can make the area from your calf to ankle look unattractive. Leg liposuction is a good solution to this problem and makes this area shapely and graceful. Women with oversized breasts may feel uncomfortable about their physical appearance. In addition, they may have health issues such as back pain and breathing problems. Liposuction of the breasts sculpts away excess fatty tissue, restoring a more natural and attractive breast contour. Just like women, excess fatty tissue in the male chest is a major aesthetic concern for men, and has a negative impact on their masculine looks. Male breasts can be really embarrassing. Breast reduction liposuction for men, termed gynecomastia treatment removes this excess fat and glandular tissue from the chest region. The procedure provides more definition to the muscles thereby helping to achieve a firmer, more streamlined torso. Laser liposuction at a prestigious plastic surgery center provided by a skilled and experienced plastic surgeon offers the following benefits.  Can be performed under local anesthesia Only tiny incisions are made No severe complications or risks Hardly any pain or discomfort is experienced during or after the procedure Can resume normal activities soon Only minimal bleeding and trauma to the tissues The patient remains comfortable throughout the procedure So if you are worried about any of your fat spots, and exercise and diet attempts go futile, don’t hesitate to find a good liposuction surgeon who can help restore your youthful, firm body.",
